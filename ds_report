1. Introduction<br/>
This report analyzes how trader behavior (profitability, volume, direction bias, and volume)
changes across different market sentiment regimes using Hyperliquid historical trade data and
the Crypto Fear & Greed Index (Extreme Fear, Fear, Neutral, Greed, Extreme Greed).

2. Data Preparation<br/>
- Parsed the Timestamp IST column into a proper datetime and derived a trade_date field.<br/>
- Parsed the sentiment date column and derived a sentiment_date field.<br/>
- Merged trade data with sentiment on date to assign a sentiment label to every trade.

3. Feature Engineering<br/>
- Created a profitability flag is_profitable from Closed PnL (> 0).<br/>
- Encoded trade side as side_numeric (BUY = 1, SELL = -1).<br/>
- Aggregated daily metrics by (trade_date, classification):<br/>
  • Daily PnL (sum and mean)<br/>
  • Daily trading volume (Size USD)<br/>
  • Daily win rate (mean of is_profitable)<br/>
  • Long/short bias (mean of side_numeric)

4. Key Insights<br/>
- Win Rate: The average daily win rate is highest during Extreme Greed days, indicating that
strong bullish sentiment tends to coincide with more favorable trading conditions and clearer
trends.<br/>
- Volume: Trading volume (Size USD) is highest during Extreme Fear and Fear, suggesting
that traders become most active during periods of uncertainty and heightened volatility.<br/>
- PnL: The best PnL environments are generally observed at sentiment extremes (Extreme Fear
and Extreme Greed), while Neutral and moderate Greed show weaker performance and lower
activity.<br/>
- Direction Bias: There is a noticeable short bias during Extreme Greed, which may indicate
that traders hedge or fade overly optimistic moves. During Fear/Extreme Fear, traders often
follow the trend but with mixed long/short behavior depending on conditions.

5. Conclusions & Strategy Implications<br/>
- Sentiment extremes (Extreme Fear and Extreme Greed) are the most informative regimes for
active trading strategies, offering both volatility and edge in PnL and win rate.<br/>
- Neutral and moderate Greed regimes can be considered low-opportunity environments with
relatively weaker performance and lower volume.<br/>
- A sentiment-aware trading system could dynamically adjust risk and position sizing based on
the current sentiment regime:<br/>
  • Scale up risk during Extreme Fear/Extreme Greed (with strict risk controls).<br/>
  • Scale down or avoid trading during Neutral periods.<br/>
  • Monitor short build-up during Extreme Greed as a potential signal for mean reversion.
